===============================================
 FIREBASE SETUP - COMPLETE! ✅
===============================================

✅ COMPLETED:
1. Fixed multiple Firebase initializations
2. Removed Firebase compat library (now using modern v9+ SDK)
3. Created .env.local with your Firebase credentials
4. Generated firebase-messaging-sw.js automatically
5. Installed dotenv dependency
6. Added automatic service worker generation scripts

===============================================
 ✅ VAPID KEY CONFIGURED!
===============================================

Your Firebase configuration is now COMPLETE with:
✅ All Firebase credentials
✅ VAPID key for push notifications
✅ Auto-generated service worker

Your app is ready to send/receive push notifications!

===============================================
 HOW TO RUN
===============================================

Development:
  npm run dev

Build for Production:
  npm run build
  npm start

The service worker will auto-generate before dev/build!

===============================================
 WHAT WAS FIXED
===============================================

BEFORE:
❌ Firebase initialized 3 times (caused conflicts)
❌ Hardcoded credentials in public folder (security risk)
❌ Mixed Firebase compat (v8) and modular (v9) libraries
❌ Service worker had exposed credentials

AFTER:
✅ Single Firebase initialization
✅ Environment variables only (.env.local)
✅ Pure modular Firebase SDK (v9+)
✅ Auto-generated service worker from env vars
✅ Secure configuration

===============================================
 FILES MODIFIED
===============================================

✅ utils/Firebase.js - Fixed initialization
✅ public/firebase-messaging-sw.js - Auto-generated
✅ package.json - Added scripts & dotenv
✅ scripts/generate-sw.js - New generator script
✅ .env.local - Created with your credentials

===============================================
 IMPORTANT NOTES
===============================================

- .env.local is gitignored (secure)
- Service worker regenerates on every build/dev
- Don't manually edit firebase-messaging-sw.js
- Add your VAPID key to enable push notifications

===============================================
